title: "Event by ID"
description: "Retrieve detailed event metadata, chats, and nested markets via gamma.events.getEventById."
---

`client.gamma.events.getEventById` fetches a single event with extensive metadata—market snapshots,
volume metrics, imagery, chat details, and template information.

## Request

```ts
const event = await client.gamma.events.getEventById(id, params);
```

### Parameters

| Name               | Type           | Required | Notes                      |
| ------------------ | -------------- | -------- | -------------------------- |
| `id`               | `number` (≥ 0) | ✅       | Event ID.                  |
| `include_chat`     | `boolean`      |          | Include chat metadata.     |
| `include_template` | `boolean`      |          | Include template metadata. |

## Response

The API returns a single `Event` object. Fields match those surfaced by the Polymarket app: titles,
descriptions, imagery, liquidity/volume metrics, nested markets, tags, chat rooms, and more.

## Usage example

```ts
const event = await client.gamma.events.getEventById(35723, {
  include_chat: true,
  include_template: true,
});

console.log(event.title, event.markets?.length);
```

## Failure modes

- `id` must be numeric.
