## Response

`Market[]` with hundreds of fields (title, question, outcomes, liquidity/volume metrics, tags,
series references, etc.). All numeric metrics are parsed as numbers.

## Usage example

```ts
const markets = await client.gamma.markets.listMarkets({
  closed: false,
  liquidity_num_min: 1000,
  limit: 10,
});

console.log(markets.map((market) => market.title ?? market.slug));
```

## Failure modes

- Invalid dates or malformed IDs → validation errors with detailed paths.
