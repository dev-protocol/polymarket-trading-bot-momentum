<Accordion title="Is this an official Polymarket SDK?">
  No. **polymarket-data** is community-maintained and not endorsed by the Polymarket team. It
  targets public endpoints published by Polymarket. Confirm contractual or compliance requirements
  with Polymarket before deploying to production.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need an API key?">
  Not for the endpoints currently implemented. If Polymarket introduces authentication, the
  community will update the SDK accordingly.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Which environments are supported?">
- Node.js 18+ (native `fetch`)
- Serverless runtimes that support ESM modules
- Browser environments, provided CORS allows the target endpoints

Supply a custom `fetch` implementation if your runtime does not expose one.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How are responses validated?">
  Every request and response flows through Zod schemas. Unexpected payloads throw descriptive
  errors, helping you spot upstream changes immediately.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if Polymarket changes an endpoint?">
Zod validation will fail with a message like:

```
Invalid response for gamma.markets.listMarkets: …
```

Capture the new payload, open an issue, and submit a PR updating the schema. Include unit/integration
tests to lock the change in place.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I contribute?">

1. Fork the repository.
2. Model the endpoint in Zod.
3. Implement the method and export types.
4. Add unit/integration tests.
5. Run lint, build, and test scripts.
6. Submit a detailed pull request.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are there rate limits?">
  Polymarket’s public APIs may enforce rate limits. Cache responses where possible and avoid
  excessive polling. Consult Polymarket’s official docs for the latest policies.
